    <h2>Before knowing about how to get started in CTF let’s first understand what CTF is, what we do in CTF, what is a flag, and is CTF helps you to polish your hacking skills.</h2>
    <p>CTF: Capture The Flag</p>
    <p>CTF: Capture the Flag is a type of information security competition that challenges competitors to solve a variety of tasks. It is a special type of cybersecurity competition designed to challenge computer participants to solve computer security problems or capture and defend computer systems. Typically, these competitions are team-based and attract a diverse range of participants including students, enthusiasts, and professionals. A CTF competition may take a few hours, a full day, or several days.</p>

    <h2>Why CTF?</h2>
    <p>Computer security represents a challenge for education due to its interdisciplinary nature. The topics of computer security range from theoretical aspects of computer technology to applied aspects of information technology management. This makes it difficult to encapsulate the feeling of constituting computer security professionals.</p>

    <h2>How to Get Started into CTF | Importance Of CTF in Bug Bounties</h2>
    <p>Types of Capture The Flag challenge</p>

    <h3>JEOPARDY STYLE:</h3>
    <p>Jeopardy-style CTFs have a couple of tasks in a range of categories. For example, web, forensics, crypto, binary, or anything else. The team can gain some points for each solved task. More points usually for more complex tasks. The next task in the series can only be opened after some team resolves the previous task. Then the playing time is more than the sum of digits which shows you the CTF winner</p>

    <h3>ATTACK DEFENSE STYLE:</h3>
    <p>Attack-defense is another interesting type of competition. Every team here has its own network (or only one host) with rude services. Your team has time to patch your services and usually develop adventures. So, then the organizers add the contest participants and the battle begins! You should protect your own services for defense points and hack opponents for attack points.</p>

    <h3>MIXED STYLE</h3>
    <p>Possible formats for mixed competitions may vary. This can be something like a wargame with specific times for task-based elements.</p>

    <p>CTF games often touch on many other aspects of information security: cryptography, stenography, binary analysis, reverse arranging, mobile security, and others.</p>

    <h2>Challenge Types & Tools</h2>

    <h3>Cryptography:</h3>
    <p>In the case of CTFs, the goal is usually to crack or clone cryptographic objects or algorithms to reach the flag.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FeatherDuster — An automated, modular cryptanalysis tool</li>
        <li>Hash Extender — A utility tool for performing hash length extension attacks</li>
        <li>PkCrack — A tool for Breaking PkZip-encryption</li>
        <li>RSATool — Generate private key with knowledge of p and q</li>
        <li>XORTool — A tool to analyze multi-byte xor cipher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steganography</h3>
    <p>In the context of CTFs steganography usually involves finding the hints or flags that have been hidden with steganography. Most commonly a media file will be given as a task with no further instructions, and the participants have to be able to uncover the message that has been encoded in the media.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Steghide — Hide data in various kind of images</li>
        <li>Stegsolve — Apply various steganography techniques to images</li>
        <li>Zsteg — PNG/BMP analysis</li>
        <li>Exiftool — Read and write meta information in files</li>
        <li>Pngtools — For various analysis related to PNGs</li>
    </ul>
